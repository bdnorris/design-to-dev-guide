# Advanced Strategies for Images

There are some new strategies available in the browser that might be helpful for you to know about.

## Object Fit

Object-fit is a way to make content items fill their given space in both directions, similar to a background image.

This can be done with images and videos. 

## Srcset

This is a new coding strategy that allows us to only deliver retina images to screens that actually are retina. That way, we don't send images that are larger than they need to be. 

This does mean we either need both the retina and the non-retina images to be handed off, or, use an image delivery service.
