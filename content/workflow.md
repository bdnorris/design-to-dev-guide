# Workflow

# Styletiles

One way to quickly iterate on the styles for a web project without having to complete full page designs too early.

## Audience

Although style tiles are great for communicating amongst a design and development team, the ultimate audience for them is the client. Theyâ€™re meant to quickly get feedback and show possible directions.

## Level of Detail

Style tiles are general. They exist to communicate mood and the general design direction.

## Prototyping

There's tremendous value of prototyping interactive designs prior to full development. Having an interactive example before full coding can reveal design and content issues. Interactivity adds a the dimension of time and what we generally refer to as "navigation." Both big issues and small ones can be revealed by adding this step to your workflow.

There are several levels of prototyping, each taking up a different amounts of time and effort (\$\$\$). Choosing the right one depends on the complexity, size and importance of the project.

- In app prototyping: Next generation digital design tools like XD and Sketch have a certain amount of protyping built in. These tools are getting better and better and will continue to improve. The mostly allow navigation through a design via click points that move you from artboard to artboard (page/view to page/view). These can sometimes include animation.
- Online prototyping: InVision (and others) can create similar prototypes online via clickable hotspots. Usually, design files can be uploaded directly from Sketch, etc. but flat image files can also be used if you are working in a legacy design application.
- Quick code prototypes: Sometimes it just makes sense to start coding. These prototypes can use mock data, skipping actual complicated back-end functionality. The goal is to get coding with a lower-fidelity design to test interactivity specifically instead of worrying about details.

For a typical website, the first two are suffecient. Code prototypes are often only necessary with more complicated tools (filters, quizes/wizards, calculators)

# Iterative Design

Prototyping and wireframes can lead to a more iterative approach design problems.

Linear Workflow: Sitemap > Wireframe > Prototype > Copy > Design > Develop
Iterative: Sitemap > Wireframe/Copy/Prototype/Design, repeat.

Element Collages
Atomic Web Design
Style Tiles
For larger projects, think beyond layouts and pages, think about modular and systems (design as legos).
