# Client Review

Getting proper approvals from all stake-holders on a design is critical if you're following a typical waterfall development process where development is assumed the last and final step. This is typical for digital marketing efforts (as opposed to internal tools or other software development projects).

## Workflow

Make sure a developer sees the design before it goes to the client. 

Why?
- The developer can point out where the design is not feasible or where it may be difficult to implement.
	- The developer can confirm if the original budget and timeline are still feasible. 
	- If not, the developer can point out where the design needs to be simplified or where the timeline needs to be extended.
- The developer can also point out where the design is not responsive or where it may be difficult to implement responsiveness.
- The developer can point out where the design is not accessible or where it may be difficult to implement accessibility.
- The developer can also put together a list of requirements that are still missing or unclear, and otherwise help with questions that still need to be asked.'

## Review Method

It's extremely important that the client view the mock-ups properly. Client's often do not have the same type of hardware as designers and likely have smaller or less pixel-dense screens. Make sure they are viewing the design at 100% zoom and on the same type of device they will be using to view the final product.

For Adobe XD Links, make sure the client is setting the view to 100% zoom. 

## Browsers

The scope of work should have noted which browsers the client wants to support. If this is missing, let's make sure we find out.
